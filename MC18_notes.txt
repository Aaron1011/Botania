* Updated to BlockPos and EnumFacing everywhere where it made sense
* Registering repainting blocks will need to also receive a PropertyEnum with EnumDyeColor as the component type
so Botania knows what property to set the color on
* ICorporeaSpark.getInventory had to be changed to ICorporeaSpark.getSparkInventory because the signature clashed (IInventory vs ItemStack[], respectively)
This can be changed to match vanilla signature, but either would break backward compat.
* SubTileEntity.getComparatorInputOverride parameter removed (it was actually incorrect also. Not side, but the meta of the block).
Anyways, vanilla removed it from their method so we follow suit.
* SubTileEntity's methods that are copied from block (onBlockadded, etc.) updated to match vanilla counterparts
* Multiblock system reworked to use states and blockposes
* Magnet blacklist still uses metas instead of states because they need to support the short maxvalue wildcard.
* Now includes a way for addons to pass the Botania loader the models they want to use to render their subtile with
* Removed icon methods from SubTileSignature

-- Other --
* Lang entries to be updated in non-english: Corporea funnel new numbers. Moving of prismarine entry.
* Most things left untouched to make patches from upstream easier
* Most uses of chunkcoordinates directly convert blockpos (THANK YOU VAZKII FOR USING THEM). Remove creation of extra instances
since BlockPos'es are immutable and thus can be reused everywhere.
* Some really needed fields in EntityItem are private now. Reflection time :(
* Alfglass now just uses the vanilla random model selection system to choose a pattern. Some of your builds may look different.
Unless someone figures out a way to use the old one
* The alt textures will probably be a resource pack now to decrease complexity...
sorry :/ The systems needed to dynamically switch out the textures like that is not worth just throwing them into a resource pack
* Slabs are kinda janky if you look at them - Mojang made some extremely silly assumptions and we're going to have to go with them
* Quartz stair textures may be assigned incorrectly - resource pack authors check me
* Glass pane inner faces are not getting culled (vanilla bug?)
* Some item forms of technical/non-user blocks are removed
    * Full list: [all double slab items, all solid vine items]
